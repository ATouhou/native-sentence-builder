native-sentence-builder
=======================

A powerful PHP class with a few demos and sample verbs that builds a user readable string out of a subject, verb, object and viewer passed as arguments. It supports both English and Arabic.
This is an alpha version. Any suggestions/contributions to help improve the project are welcome.
